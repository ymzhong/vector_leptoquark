# vector_leptoquark

The repository contains several vector leptoquark models for collider studies. We have uploaded both UFO model files for MC simulators and the generateing FeynRules model files. The physics and features of these vector leptoquark models are described in [JHEP 10 (2017) 097](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2017)097) and [JHEP 01 (2019) 132](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP01%282019%29132)

Please acknowledge [JHEP 10 (2017) 097](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2017)097) and [JHEP 01 (2019) 132](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP01%282019%29132) if you used the repository models.

If you have any questions on the models, please reach Yiming Zhong (ymzhong@kicp.uchicago.edu) or Martin Schmaltz (schmaltz@bu.edu).
