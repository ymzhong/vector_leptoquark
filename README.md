# vector_leptoquark

The repository contains several vector leptoquark models for collider studies. We have uploaded both Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) files for MC simulators and the generating FeynRules files for the models. 

The model [vleptoquark_tta](./vleptoquark_tta_UFO) contains a vector leptoquark (vul) couples to top and taus. The Standard Model quantum number (SU(3), SU(2), Y) for the vector leptoquark is (3, 1, 5/3). Its decay channel is vul > t ta+. The model [vleptoquark_te_tmu](./vleptoquark_te_tmu_UFO) contains a vector leptoquark with the same Standard Model quantum number. But instead, it couples to top and electrons, and top and muons. The decay channel is vul > t e+ and t mu+.

More details on the physics of these vector leptoquark models can be found in [JHEP 10 (2017) 097](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2017)097) and [JHEP 01 (2019) 132](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP01%282019%29132).
